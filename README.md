# Week_3_challenge
### Third challenge: 
   For this challenge we are creating two bank accounts one savings and one cd
   which are instances of the Account class.

## Project modules:
1) The Account module which hosts Account class and is 
   in the Account package.

2) The cd_account module which hosts the create_cd_account function and is in
   the create_accounts module.

3) The savings_account module which hosts the create_savings_account function and
   is in the create_accounts module

4) The input_info module which hosts the input_info function and
   is in the create_accounts module

Finally the customer_banking file hosts the main() function which implements the
create_savings account and create_cd_account function and prints out the
inicial balance, interest rate, interest earnd, maturity period and the updated balance
of the accounts generated.

## Note:
        The functions output should have been the Account objects themselves 
        and the account info extracted from them instead of outputing the account
        info from the functions.
